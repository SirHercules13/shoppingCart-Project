# Shopping cart Project
This project was developed through the Alura's development course, wich I learned how to:

- Using the `split()` function in JavaScript, to separate sections of a String by a specific delimiter;
- Retrieve values ​​entered into form fields on the page, via the `value` property;
- Modify the HTML code of an element on the page, via the `innerHTML property;
- Use of JavaScript's *Template String* feature to concatenate variable values ​​into String.
